# Prework - *CodePathPW*

Submitted by: **Iñaki González Morales**

**CodePathPW** is an app that shows that I have the qualifications and needed understanding of IOS development topics needed to be part of the IOS Development Path. The app shows three labels containing information about myself and a button that, when clicked, it randomly changes the background color . 

Time spent: **2-ish** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [YES] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [YES] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite apps and why they are my favorites:

-Instagram: quality of pictures and video, message function with lots of different message formats and the live streaming function.
-Google Chrome: speed and quality of search, quantity of useful resources that everyone can find and use, the fact that it is undoubtedly the software of the century because it provides us with infinite learning possibilities.
-GBM: reliability on orders, process transparency and speed and quality of transactions. 
-YouTube: amount of content, monetization possibilities and quality of videos.

Considering what I like from these apps, I would like to create an app that is reliable, fast and offers quality content to users. My areas of interest are fitness, business and technology. Considering the current app offer globally and locally, I think that there are still a lot of things to get done in the fitness industry. Therefore, the app that I would create would be about tracking fitness of the users. Maybe implement some artificial intelligence algorithm that creates the best workouts for each individual user, making all the sometimes troublesome process of training something much easier and fit to the user's needs. It can progress to the point that it can also recommend to you a nutrition plan (always suggesting professional advice) and tell you which meals you can make considering your preferences and budget.



## Notes

The only challenge that I encountered was that I was using an IBOutlet instead of an IBAction, which didn't let me make the button work. I solved it by looking at the support workspace that the institution provides. I think that this path will teach me a lot of useful things and will enable me to enhance my IOS development skills.
